  <h2> to have the best night sleep you've had in years </h2>
  <h3> Shakespeare's sonnet 27: </h3> <br> <br>

<br> <br>
  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,<br>
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;<br>
But then begins a journey in my head, <br>
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:<br>
For then my thoughts (from far where I abide) <br>
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee, <br>
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide, <br>
Looking on darkness which the blind do see: <br>
Save that my soul's imaginary sight <br>
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<br>
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night, <br>
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.<br>
   Lo, thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,<br>
   For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.
